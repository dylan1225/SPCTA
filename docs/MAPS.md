# Maps and Routing ‚Äî Detailed Guide

This document explains the two mapping widgets in this repo, their features, how to configure Google APIs, and how to control them from your PyQt app.


## Components

- `web_embed/maps/map_widget.py` ‚Äî `MapsWidget`: a Google Maps JavaScript embed with search, place details, directions, and a built‚Äëin pickup planner (VRP).
- `web_embed/mini_map.py` ‚Äî `MiniMapWidget`: a compact Leaflet map for showing current location and heading.
- Assets used by `MapsWidget`:
  - `web_embed/maps/map.html` ‚Äî main HTML template
  - `web_embed/maps/map.css` ‚Äî styles (dark theme, panels, controls)
  - `web_embed/maps/map.js` ‚Äî logic (search, places, directions, VRP)


## `MapsWidget` (Google Maps)

Constructor:
```
MapsWidget(api_key: str | None = None, center: tuple[float,float] = (40.758, -73.9855))
```

Behavior:
- Injects the provided API key into `map.html` and loads the Google Maps JavaScript API from the network.
- Applies a custom Vector Map Style ID via `VECTOR_MAP_ID` constant in `map_widget.py`.
- Grants Geolocation permission (via `_GeoPage.featurePermissionRequested`).

UI features (from map.html/css/js):
- Search bar: type a destination, autocomplete results panel appears below. Selecting a result opens the info box.
- Place info box: photo, rating, address, phone; ‚ÄúDirections‚Äù button to start routing from current origin.
- Directions: Uses Google Directions API to compute a route and display turn‚Äëby‚Äëturn. A ‚ÄúNext turn‚Äù box shows the upcoming maneuver and distance.
- Recenter FAB: returns camera to the user‚Äôs current position and zooms in.
- Geolocation tracking: watches position and heading, shows an arrow marker and an accuracy circle.
- Pickup Planner (VRP):
  - Open/Close panel: left side ‚Äúüì¶ Planner‚Äù button.
  - Depot: set via current center, locate me, or place search/autocomplete.
  - Capacity: integer capacity for the vehicle per trip.
  - Pickups: add multiple pickup locations via a modal place search or saved locations. Each pickup supports a demand quantity.
  - Saved locations: persist to `localStorage` with name and coordinates; reuse or set as Depot; delete individual items.
  - Manual order: when enabled, routes are built in entered order with capacity splitting.
  - Optimized order: when disabled, builds a duration matrix using Google Distance Matrix API; falls back to Haversine if the matrix call fails. Greedy VRP heuristic splits into multiple trips as needed by capacity.
  - Trip rendering: each trip is drawn in a different color; summary and per‚Äëleg distances/durations shown in the info panel.


### Google Cloud configuration

Required APIs (enable in Google Cloud Console for your project):
- Maps JavaScript API
- Places API
- Directions API
- Distance Matrix API

Steps:
1) Create a project and enable billing (required by Google Maps APIs).
2) Enable the four APIs above.
3) Create an API key.
4) Restrictions:
   - For a desktop PyQt/QWebEngine app, ‚ÄúHTTP referrer‚Äù restrictions do not apply reliably. Consider:
     - Using no application restriction but applying API restrictions to only the above APIs and setting per‚ÄëAPI quota limits.
     - Or proxying Google API calls via your backend so the key is never shipped to the client (advanced).
   - Always rotate keys if leaked and monitor usage.
5) Provide the key to `MapsWidget`:
   - Environment variable: `export GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="..."`
   - Or pass explicitly: `MapsWidget(api_key="...")`

Vector Map Style (mapId):
- `VECTOR_MAP_ID` in `map_widget.py` controls the map style. Create a custom style in Google Cloud Console (Maps Styling), obtain its Map ID, and set it there.


### Permissions and privacy

- Geolocation: The widget requests geolocation via the browser runtime. The Qt page `_GeoPage` grants permission only for `QWebEnginePage.Geolocation`. OS‚Äëlevel location permissions must be granted by the user/system.
- Network: All Google services are loaded from the network. Ensure connectivity and that corporate firewalls/proxies allow access.
- The ‚ÄúLocate Me‚Äù fallback may query `https://ipapi.co/json/` if the browser geolocation fails; this is used only to approximate position. You can remove or firewall this if undesired.


### Programmatic control from Python

You can drive the map at runtime by executing JavaScript on the page:

- Center the map:
```
view = maps_widget.page()
lat, lng = 37.7749, -122.4194
js = f"map.setCenter(new google.maps.LatLng({lat}, {lng})); map.setZoom(14);"
maps_widget.page().runJavaScript(js)
```

- Route to a destination coordinate:
```
lat, lng = 37.779, -122.419
js = f"routeTo(new google.maps.LatLng({lat}, {lng}));"
maps_widget.page().runJavaScript(js)
```

- Open the planner UI:
```
maps_widget.page().runJavaScript("document.getElementById('vrpOpen').click();")
```

- Clear VRP overlays (if present):
```
maps_widget.page().runJavaScript("(window.clearVRPRoutes||function(){})();")
```

Note: these calls rely on functions and globals defined in `map.js` and may no‚Äëop if the page has not finished initializing. If needed, connect to the QWebEngineView `loadFinished` signal.


## `MiniMapWidget` (Leaflet)

Behavior:
- Loads Leaflet CSS/JS from unpkg CDN and initializes a simple OpenStreetMap basemap.
- Shows a heading arrow marker that rotates with movement; approximates bearing if heading is unavailable.
- Disables scroll/drag interactions to keep the map static in a small area.

Notes:
- Requires internet access to fetch Leaflet and OSM tiles (unpkg and tile servers). For offline or locked‚Äëdown environments, consider bundling Leaflet assets and pointing to a self‚Äëhosted tile server.
- No Google API key is required for MiniMap.


## Troubleshooting

- Blank map or errors about API key:
  - Verify `GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` is set and correct.
  - Ensure the four Google APIs are enabled.
  - Check console logs (run app from terminal) for network/permission errors.

- Geolocation not working:
  - Ensure OS location services are enabled for your user.
  - On Linux, some distros require additional services (e.g., GeoClue). Qt uses Chromium‚Äôs geolocation; ensure it can talk to geolocation providers.

- Directions/DistanceMatrix errors:
  - Inspect quota and billing in Google Cloud; exceeded quotas return errors.
  - The VRP planner falls back to a Haversine‚Äëbased matrix when Distance Matrix fails.

- Slow loads:
  - Consider preloading fonts and reducing photo sizes in place details.
  - Vector maps and Places searches can be network‚Äëheavy; cache or limit requests.


## Security considerations

- API key exposure: A desktop webview ships the key to the client. Prefer strict API restrictions and quotas; consider proxying sensitive endpoints via your backend if you need tighter control.
- LocalStorage: Saved locations are stored locally in the webview profile; they do not sync across machines.
